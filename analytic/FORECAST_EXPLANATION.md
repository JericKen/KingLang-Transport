# 📊 Booking Forecast Chart Explanation

## What This Chart Shows

The **30-Day Booking Forecast** chart uses **ARIMA+ machine learning** to predict future bookings based on historical patterns.

---

## 📈 Chart Components

### 1. **Predicted Bookings Line (Purple)**

- **What it shows:** The most likely number of bookings for each future date
- **Example:** "January 8, 2025 → 115 bookings expected"
- **How to read:** This is your best estimate of future demand

### 2. **Upper Confidence Bound (Red Dashed Line)**

- **What it shows:** The maximum likely bookings (worst-case/best-case scenario)
- **Example:** "January 8, 2025 → Could be as high as 125 bookings"
- **How to read:** Prepare resources for this upper limit

### 3. **Lower Confidence Bound (Green Dashed Line)**

- **What it shows:** The minimum likely bookings
- **Example:** "January 8, 2025 → Could be as low as 105 bookings"
- **How to read:** Expect at least this many bookings

## 🔍 Example Data Interpretation

```
Date: 2025-01-08
├── Lower Bound: 105 bookings (minimum expected)
├── Prediction:  115 bookings (most likely)
└── Upper Bound: 125 bookings (maximum expected)
```

**Business Decision:**

- **Book 115 buses** as baseline
- **Have 10 extra buses** on standby (125 - 115)
- **Plan for minimum 105** to avoid overbooking
